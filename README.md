ABSTRACT\
The article constitutes a critical intervention in the current, dramaticdebate on the consequences of algorithms and automation forsociety. While most research has focused on negative outcomes,including ethical problems of machine bias and accountability,little has been said about the possibilities of users to resistalgorithmic power. The article draws on Raymond Williams’workon media as practice to advance a framework for studyingalgorithms with a focus on user agency. We illustrate thisframework with the example of the media activist campaignWorld White Web by the Swedish artist and visual designerJohanna Burai. We suggest that user agency in relation toalgorithms can emerge from alternative uses of platforms, in theaftermath of algorithmic logics, and give birth to complicit formsof resistance that work through‘repair’politics oriented towardscorrecting the work of algorithms. We conclude with a discussionof the ways in which the proposed framework helps us rethinkdebates on algorithmic power.

Introduction and outline\
Discourses  on  algorithms  are  increasingly  populating  the  media  and pervading public conversations. Newspapers  are  filled  with  stories  on  how  algorithmic  power  is  impactingour choices in the realms of politics, journalism, music, sport, research, and healthcare. Therecent  inclusion  of  the  term  in  the  influential  “Digital  Keywords”  volume  (Peters  2016) also signals a growing interest in the concept and its consequences within various fields and strands  of  research  in  the  academia,  and  especially  within  media  studies.  As  Gillespie  (2016) has pointed out, the term appears in recent scholarship not only as a noun but alsoincreasingly   as   an   adjective,   in   relation   to   issues   of   identity,   culture,   ideology,   accountability, governance, imaginary  and  regulation.  In  this  chapter,   I  focus  on  the  changes that algorithmic power is bringing to the realm of politics and the transformations of digital activism. The chapter begins with a brief outline of the significance of algorithms in  digital politics.  Then,  it  focuses  on  two  diverse  conceptions  and  manifestations  of algorithmic   power   in politics   (algorithm   as   propaganda/repression   and   algorithm   as   appropriation/ resistance) that emerge from the explorations of two case studies.
